## 🔍 Introduction
The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This capstone quarter introduces Physical AI—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. Students learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac. This module lays the groundwork for understanding this exciting field, bridging the gap between digital intelligence and physical embodiment.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### Foundations of Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence
Physical AI focuses on intelligent systems that interact with the real world, understanding and responding to physical laws. Embodied intelligence refers to the idea that an agent's intelligence is deeply tied to its physical body and its interactions with the environment. This contrasts with purely digital AI that operates solely in virtual spaces.

### From Digital AI to Robots that Understand Physical Laws
Historically, AI has excelled in tasks within controlled, digital environments. Physical AI challenges this by demanding systems that can perceive, reason, and act within the complexities of the real world, accounting for physics, uncertainty, and dynamic interactions. Humanoid robots are a prime example, requiring AI that understands balance, locomotion, and manipulation in a human-centric environment.

### Overview of Humanoid Robotics Landscape
Humanoid robots are designed to resemble humans, enabling them to navigate and perform tasks in environments built for people. Their development involves complex fields like kinematics, dynamics, control theory, and advanced AI for perception and decision-making. The landscape is rapidly evolving with advancements in sensing, actuation, and AI algorithms.

### Sensor Systems: LIDAR, Cameras, IMUs, and Force/Torque Sensors
Robots perceive their environment using a variety of sensors:
- **LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)**: Provides precise distance measurements, crucial for mapping and navigation.
- **Cameras**: Offer visual data for object recognition, tracking, and environmental understanding (Computer Vision).
- **IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units)**: Measure orientation, angular velocity, and gravitational force, essential for balance and motion control.
- **Force/Torque Sensors**: Detect forces and torques applied to robot joints or end-effectors, vital for delicate manipulation and safe human-robot interaction.
