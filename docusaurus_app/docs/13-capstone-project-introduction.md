## 🔍 Introduction
The Capstone Project serves as the culmination of your learning journey in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. It challenges you to integrate the concepts and technical skills acquired throughout the course into a comprehensive, real-world-inspired robotic application. The central theme for this capstone is "The Autonomous Humanoid," where you will design, implement, and demonstrate a simulated humanoid robot capable of understanding and executing complex commands. This project will test your ability to bridge the gap between digital intelligence and physical embodiment, providing invaluable experience in system design, AI integration, and robotic control.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### Project Design Document
Before diving into implementation, a thorough design document is crucial.
- **Problem Statement Refinement**: Clearly define the specific problem your autonomous humanoid will solve.
- **System Architecture**: Outline the high-level components of your robot's software, including ROS 2 nodes, AI models (perception, planning, control), and communication flows.
- **Technical Specifications**: Detail the expected performance, sensors, actuators, and software libraries to be used.
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential challenges and propose mitigation strategies.

### Planning Engineering Tasks
Effective project management is key to success.
- **Task Breakdown**: Decompose the project into smaller, manageable engineering tasks with clear objectives.
- **Dependency Mapping**: Identify task dependencies and define a logical sequence for implementation.
- **Milestone Definition**: Establish key milestones with deliverables and timelines.
- **Version Control**: Utilize Git for collaborative development and version management.

### Building a Novel Robotic Application
This phase involves hands-on implementation, integrating knowledge from all modules.
- **ROS 2 Integration**: Developing and connecting ROS 2 nodes for communication between different robot functionalities (e.g., perception, navigation, manipulation).
- **AI Model Deployment**: Integrating pre-trained or newly developed AI models for tasks such as object recognition, natural language understanding, and motion planning.
- **Simulation Environment Setup**: Configuring Isaac Sim or Gazebo to create the scenario for your autonomous humanoid.
- **Control Algorithm Implementation**: Writing code to translate AI decisions into physical actions for the simulated robot, focusing on stability and precision.

### Final Presentation Guidelines
Communicating your work effectively is as important as the work itself.
- **Clear Objective**: State the problem, your approach, and your solution clearly.
- **Technical Demonstration**: Showcase your simulated humanoid's capabilities through a live or recorded demo.
- **Architectural Overview**: Explain your system's design, highlighting key components and their interactions.
- **Challenges and Learnings**: Discuss problems encountered and lessons learned during the project.

### Grading Rubric
Your project will be evaluated based on several criteria, including:
- **Functionality**: Does the robot perform the specified tasks correctly and robustly?
- **Technical Depth**: Demonstrated understanding and application of course concepts (ROS 2, Simulation, NVIDIA Isaac, etc.).
- **Code Quality**: Readability, modularity, commenting, and adherence to best practices.
- **Design Document Quality**: Clarity, completeness, and foresight in planning.
- **Presentation Quality**: Clarity, engagement, and effectiveness in conveying the project.

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation
- Setting up a ROS 2 package for the Capstone project.
- Defining a simple state machine for robot behavior.
- Integrating a basic perception node with a navigation stack in simulation.

## 🧪 Hands-on Activities / Labs
- **Lab 7.1**: Draft a preliminary design document for your autonomous humanoid, including a simplified system architecture.
- **Lab 7.2**: Implement a basic command parsing mechanism using an LLM to interpret a voice command into a simple robot action.
- **Lab 7.3**: Configure a simulated robot to execute a sequence of actions based on your parsed command.
