## Prompt Text (Verbatim)

```text
A
```

## Response Text (Summary)

The user clarified that the final research paper PDF output should have specific quality requirements, including embedded fonts, high-resolution graphics, and proper metadata. This was recorded in the `specs/001-ai-k12-efficiency/spec.md` file as a new functional requirement (FR-004.1) and in the Clarifications section.

## Outcome

The specification has been updated to include a clarification regarding PDF output quality and a corresponding functional requirement. This reduces ambiguity for the implementation phase.

## Evaluation

**Clarity:** Improved.
**Completeness:** Improved.
**Consistency:** Maintained.
