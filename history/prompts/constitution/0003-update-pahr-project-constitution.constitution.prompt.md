Preamble

This Constitution establishes the structure, purpose, and guiding principles for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book, hereafter referred to as PAHR Project.
The PAHR Project is designed for the Hackathon challenge hosted by Specify Plus (Spec-Kit) in collaboration with the OpenAI Claude Team, showcasing excellence in technical writing, conversational AI, RAG engineering, and robotics education.

🧭 Article I — Vision & Mission
1.1 Vision

To create the world’s most accessible, structured, and high-quality textbook for beginner-to-advanced students studying Physical AI, ROS2, Humanoid Robotics, and AI-driven conversational robots.

1.2 Mission

Deliver a beautifully structured, readable, and interactive textbook.

Integrate a fast RAG AI Tutor that answers questions directly from book text.

Provide high-quality UI, responsive design, and clean navigation.

Empower students globally to learn robotics without expensive hardware.

📚 Article II — Book Structure (UI and Chapter Design)

The PAHR Book must follow a clean, modern, minimal UI layout optimized for reading.

2.1 UI Structure
